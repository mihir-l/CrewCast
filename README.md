CrewCast is a modern desktop application for sharing media and files with friends, built on top of the [iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh) protocol. It provides a simple, secure, and decentralized way to create topics (groups), chat, and share files with other users.

- **Member Status:** See which users are active in each topic.
- **Invitation Tickets:** Easily invite others to join your topic with a secure ticket.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive, themeable interface with support for light and dark modes.
- **Built with Tauri:** Cross-platform desktop app using web technologies and Rust.
